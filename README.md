# woo-cart-standalone-force-sell-sorting
This MU-Plugin helps sort Predefined Products to behave a certain way when they're added or removed from the cart page. Requires WooCommerce to Work.

## How to install
It's an MU-plugin, so add it to your `site-directory/wp-content/mu-plugins`. And you're good to go.

## This is also for the Hacktoberfest Drill, so feel free to contribute 💪🏼🥞
I also made my Phone Validator Plugin hacktoberfest-ready, but a lot of complications for now, so no time to sort it for easier contribution.
 So I got this, was a free code i wrote for someone, and later was updating it as the time went by. So yeah, it's open source. Enjoy 🏄🏽‍♂️🚀
